      "Precise timing of cacao harvest is critical to bean’s flavour.",
    paragraphSecond:
      "Instead of harvesting in a single sweep, we closely work with our 100+ farmer-member community to ensure only fully ripe pods are harvested. Our farmers detect each cacao’s ripeness through a colour and sound test. Within 24 hours, these pods are dispatched for fermentation.",

    heading: "Stringent Screening",
    paragraphFirst:
      "We carefully screen every cacao pod, discarding any that are raw, exposed, or damaged.",
    paragraphSecond:
      "To open the pods, we employ only wooden clubs instead of the conventionally used machetes or sickles. This helps prevent the beans from any potential damage.",

    heading: "Scientific Fermentation",
    paragraphFirst:
      "Pioneering a scientific approach to fermentation has been pivotal in helping us truly unlock the flavour potential of Indian cacao. The beans go through our 5-step fermentation process, carefully guided by our skilled fermenters.",
    paragraphSecond:
      "With our indigenously-developed, proprietary IOT technology, we monitor critical parameters such as temperature, pH levels, brix and humidity throughout the process.",

    heading: "Slow Drying",
    paragraphFirst:
      "The Indian Cacao is characterised as having an unappealing flavour, and with sharp acidic notes.",
    paragraphSecond:
      "This can be attributed to careless drying methods. Our cacao beans are meticulously slow-dried to remove excess moisture, without losing the flavour. Drying them on movable racks allows us to alternate between sun and shade, protecting them from the harsh Indian sun.",

    heading: "Sorting & Packing",
    paragraphFirst:
      "Our beans undergo a careful hand inspection to eliminate any germinated, mouldy, or broken beans, as well as any stones or twigs. Subsequently, the beans are machine-graded according to their size, carefully separating them into small and medium sizes. Grading is essential to ensure that the beans roast evenly.",
    paragraphSecond:
      "Once sorted, the beans are precisely weighed, labelled and hermetically sealed in a barrier bag. This bag is then placed inside jute gunny sacks, creating a double-layered packaging that effectively preserves the beans’ freshness and flavour over a longer duration.",
